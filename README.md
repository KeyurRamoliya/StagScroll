# StagScroll JS
This js helps building a container that supports virtual scrolling over large static data.
This has been tested over 1 cr records and works smoothly on all the modern browsers available.
This provided many options to configure the virtualization.
Elements supported: table, div, ul, span, etc.
This is still in development phase, so any reported errors are welcomed and we will resolve those at the earliest.


Next up in this:
- Support remote calls and bind data accordingly.
